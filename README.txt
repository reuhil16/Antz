---- COSC326 - 2016 S2 - Étude 12 - Supersizing Ants ----

Thomas Farr, Reuben Hilder and Ben Scott
        
This Étude allows for the creation of complex simulations
based on Langton's ant involving multiple ants with different 
DNA. The simulation is specified in a plain text file which 
must be specified as a command line argument. 

We have provided three sample files test.txt, test2.txt and 
test3.txt and you are welcome to create your own. A guide for 
creating simulation files can be found within the files 
themselves.

The GUI features the ability to play or pause the simulation,
adjust the speed of the simulation, reload the file and 
advance the simulation by a number of steps without rendering.
All options besides reloading require that the simulation be
paused.

In the GUI it is possible to zoom using the + and - keys and
pan using the arrow keys. To center the display on the 0,0
cell, press the 0 key.

While it is not currently possible to run the program without
the GUI, the simulation itself is entirely independent allowing
for easy implementation of non-graphical functionality should
need arise in the future.
